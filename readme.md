## ðŸŒŸ What Makes Code Blink Special?

- **Write Like You Talk**  
  Describe your logic in everyday language â€” no syntax stress.  
  _e.g.,_
  
  ```nl
  input Enter your name as name
  print Hello, name
  ```

- **One-Click AI Magic**  
  Instantly convert your thoughts into clean Python code running in background.

- **External Terminal Runs**  
  Hit run, and your script launches in a native terminal like PowerShell or Terminal.app

- **Clean, Minimal Interface**  
  Inspired by VS Code â€” tabs, line numbers, a log panel, and basic file ops. Thatâ€™s it.
